# Thesis - Predication of bitter peptides using machine learning techniques
Abstract:
In this post-genomic era, the prediction of peptide bitterness directly from the sequence is an important element in developing drugs and nutritional studies. Identifying bitter peptides using an experimental method such as in-vivo and in-vitro approaches that include “human taste panel studies” can be arduous, tiresome, time-consuming, and costly. In contrast to the state-of-the-art approaches, this thesis proposes to explore various machine learning techniques specifically, a stacking-based approach for an effective prediction of bitter peptides directly from the peptide sequence. In addition, this work explores various feature encoding and transformation techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, K-mers Feature Extraction, and Count Vectorizer. Finally, to validate the robustness, the proposed stacking-based model is compared with the other machine learning algorithms as well as an existing method by utilizing the standard performance evaluation metrics such as Sensitivity, Accuracy, Specificity, and Mathew’s Correlation Coefficient obtained through cross-validation and independent testing.
